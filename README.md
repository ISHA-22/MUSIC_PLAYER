# MUSIC_PLAYER
I developed this project to enhance my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT 
Build a music player using the above mentioned skills. This music player will have all the features found in a typical music player.
You will be able to add, play, pause and seek songs that you have added to the playlist.
